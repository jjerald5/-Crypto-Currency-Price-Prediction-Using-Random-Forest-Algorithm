# -Crypto-Currency-Price-Prediction-Using-Random-Forest-Algorithm
This project is based on creating a model to predict the crypto currency price using ML algorithms. The process started from data cleaning, data processing, EDA and model building with suitable algorithm by evaluating the R-square value. In this we are using Random Forest algorithm.
